              Raus, a hospitality-tech company, offers urban residents a break

              To simplify the trip planning process for Raus guests, we created

            </p>
            <p>
              After booking, guests received multiple transactional emails with
              information on check-in/out times, directions, house rules, or
              local recommendations. This confused guests and operational
              challenges for our team.

          <p class="txt-upcase txt-x-small mt-60 mb-10">1️⃣ Project kick-off</p>
          <p>
            The Project Manager and I designed together the product roadmap. Our
            strategy involved launching a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with just
            essential features. This approach allowed us to quickly start, test
            the product on selected cabins, and make improvements based on guest
            feedback.
          </p>
          <p class="txt-upcase txt-x-small mt-70 mb-none">2️⃣ Explore</p>
          <p>
            In this phase, we explored various solutions for how the app should
            work and determined the key features needed. Our goal was to create
            a guide where all the necessary information would be easy to find.
          </p>

          <p>
            After several rounds of sketches, low fidelity wireframes, and
            iterations with the stakeholders, we generated a lofi prototype to
            test internally.
          </p>
          <p class="txt-upcase txt-x-small mt-70 mb-none">3️⃣ Deliver</p>
          <p>
            We internally tested our low-fidelity prototype and made iterations
            until we were confident in launching it. Throughout the delivery
            phase, the prototype evolved from low fidelity to a more detailed
            version. To speed up the process, we utilized pre-existing UI
            components from our website.
          </p>
          <p class="txt-upcase txt-x-small mt-70 mb-none">4️⃣ Implementation</p>
          <p>
            We used the final prototype as the hand-off tool for developers. All
            the flows, screens, and animations were well-defined from the
            beginning. During this phase, I assisted the developers, helping
            them with any questions they had about the design and user flows.
          </p>
          <p class="txt-upcase txt-x-small mt-70 mb-none">🚀 Launch</p>
          <p>
            For the launch, we chose specific cabins to run a soft launch. Our
            goal was to test if the Companion was functioning as intended before
            implementing it in all cabins.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also modified our transactional emails to inform our guests about
            the new guidebook. This way, Raus guests could make the jump to the
            guidebook smoothly.

          <p>
            We didn’t have the resources to conduct detailed user testing, but
            we had a feedback form that we sent to all our guests after their
            stay with Raus. The response rate for this form was quite high, so
            we were confident that we would receive enough feedback to improve
            the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a few weeks, we received valuable feedback from our guests,
            allowing us to start making small adjustments to Companion. We
            iterated over time, working towards creating a better product.

          <p>
            The Companion project was my first time working in every step of the
            process, from planning the roadmap to overseeing the final product
            implementation. Since I was new in the company and the only
            designer, and it was also the first time we made a product from
            scratch at Raus, things didn't go as smoothly as I hoped.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the challenges, this experience taught me valuable lessons
            in stakeholder management and improved my ability to communicate
            design concepts effectively to non-design audiences.

              After a few weeks since the MVP launch, we received valuable
              feedback and had enough time to make improvements and incorporate
              the missing features. We introduced a new key feature for
              purchasing extras and successfully implemented Raus Companion in
              all cabins.
