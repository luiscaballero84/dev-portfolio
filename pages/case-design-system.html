              When I joined Raus, there was no organization of design assets in
              Figma; we didn't even have a company Figma account. As the first
              and only designer at the company, it wasn't surprising 🙂.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the significant amount of work required to create a design
              system, building one wasn't a top priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I knew I needed to establish some basic brand elements
              and UI components to make my design workflow more efficient. These
              will also serve as the groundwork for a complete design system in
              the future.

            <h3 class="mt-20 mb-40">Project kick-off</h3>
            <p>
              I knew we didn't have the time or resources to implement a proper
              design system right now, but I wanted to establish the first
              building block in this direction. I only had time to work on this
              when there was nothing else to do, which was actually pretty rare.
              I had to be pragmatic and use my time wisely.
            </p>
            <p>
              I created a mini-roadmap with the features I wanted to implement,
              along with a list of steps to be done. This way, whenever I had a
              small chunk of free time, I could easily dive into this project
              and solve the next task on the list. I needed to be practical and
              focus on continuous intermittent improvement over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I began this project, the website code served as the sole
              source of truth for design elements. I examined the code and
              extracted key variables such as colors and typography, which I
              then translated into Figma styles.

            <p>
              First, I separated the main parts of our design system into
              different Figma libraries. This way, we could activate or
              deactivate the libraries as needed, instead of having one large
              library for all the elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to start with colors, as they seemed the easiest to
              accomplish. They were already saved as variables in our codebase,
              so I just needed to copy the color values and save them in Figma
              as color styles.

            <p>
              Next up was typography, and this one was a bit tricky. Since Figma
              doesn't support responsive typography, I had to be practical and
              find the easiest way to handle it.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some technical analysis, I created a type scale based on the
              established breakpoints of the website. For convenience, I
              included the breakpoint name, the device, and the range of pixels
              used.

            <p>
              Another challenge I encountered was the lack of a unified icon
              library. Whenever a new icon was required, it was sourced from a
              different random collection. As a result, icons ended up with
              inconsistent styles.
            </p>
            <p>
              To solve this, we decided to implement a new unified icon library.
              Given the time constraints, we searched for an existing library
              that met two key criteria: a vast collection of high-quality icons
              and a style similar to our current icons.
            </p>
            <p>
              We settled on the Google Materials Symbols icon library. With over
              2500 well-designed glyphs and a handy Figma plugin, it is
              incredibly easy and fast to use.

              Brand Illustrations: vectorizing for versatility
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our brand illustrations, created by the talented Olga Prader, are
              crucial assets for our branding. They have a unique and cool vibe
              that helps us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there was a small challenge: they were in a non-vector format,
              which could be impractical for future uses and on the web.
              Luckily, the illustrations were provided in large tiff files.
            </p>
            <p>
              I took the opportunity to vectorize these illustrations and also
              saved them as components in Figma. Now, with a simple drag and
              drop, the illustrations are readily available for us to use. And
              no more heavy .png files on the web, now the illustrations are in
              practical .svg format.

                <span>✅</span> A few months later, we launched our own apparel
                shop, incorporating the illustrations into our clothing line.
                The vectorized illustrations proved to be a great time saver for
                production.

          <p>
            Even though I was already quite fluent in Figma, working on this
            project taught me new ways of doing things and implementing better
            workflows in Figma.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few months after this project, Figma launched a major update
            related to variables, transforming the way design systems are
            created. It was a bit of a pity, but it also opened new
            possibilities in how to create and manage design assets.
